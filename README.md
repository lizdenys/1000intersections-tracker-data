# 1000intersections-tracker-data

In January, NYC Mayor Adams and NYC DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez [promised to upgrade 1,000 intersections across New York City to improve pedestrian safety](https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/037-22/mayor-adams-commissioner-rodriguez-commissioner-sewell-major-new-actions-investments#/0 "Mayor Adams, Commissioner Rodriguez, Commissioner Sewell Announce Major New Actions & Investments to Improve Pedestrian Safety at Intersections - City of New York").

The [1,000 Intersections Tracker](https://1000intersections.nyc "1,000 Intersections Tracker") uses [Open Data from NYC DOT](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?Dataset-Information_Agency=Department+of+Transportation+%28DOT%29 "Browse Department of Transportation (DOT) data - NYC Open Data") to track progress towards that goal.

The city didn't say when the 1,000 intersections would be completed, but did state that in 2022, 100 raised crosswalks would be constructed, 100 intersections would be "daylighted" with bike corrals, and 100 intersections would have increased turn calming. Additionally, the city also didn't specify the metrics to determine the 1,000 intersections. The 1,000 Intersections Tracker notes which intersections have been updated since the announcement and whether or not they are Vision Zero Priority intersections, sites NYC DOT has identified with disproportionately high numbers of pedestrian fatalities and severe injuries.

The 1,000 Intersections Tracker compiles changes from NYC Open Data's Raised Crosswalks, Leading Pedestrian Interval Signals (LPIs), Bicycle Parking (to get Bike Corral locations), Left Turn Calming, and Traffic Signal and All-Way Stop Study Requests datasets. There are some intersection changes that NYC DOT could implement that we believe wouldn't show up in any of these datasets, including adding Barnes Dances (or any other non-LPI signal changes), pedestrian islands, and any bulb-outs that might not be classified as turn calming.

This repository provides a history of the data behind the 1,000 Intersections Tracker.
